If you’re capable of saying no to any kind of life that wouldn’t make you happy, it means you are mature enough to understand that you wont’t live forever, and you have the courage to use the time you have left in a meaningful way. Maturing as a human being requires you to listen to your inherent desire to discover. If you keep trying to silence that sense of wonder, happiness will fade away with it.",

It is enough if you don’t freeze in the cold and if thirst and hunger don’t claw at your insides. If your back isn’t broken … then whom should you envy? And why?\n\nOur envy of others devours us most of all. Prize above all else in the world those who love you and who wish you well. Do not hurt them or scold them, and never part from any of them in anger; after all, you simply do not know: it may be your last act before your arrest, and that will be how you are imprinted on their memory.",

This helps me to understand the Why of the task, and keeps me motivated when things get hard. Often the Why is something like, “To help my readers with a problem” and this feels good when I’m doing the task.
