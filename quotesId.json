If you’re capable of saying no to any kind of life that wouldn’t make you happy, it means you are mature enough to understand that you wont’t live forever, and you have the courage to use the time you have left in a meaningful way. Maturing as a human being requires you to listen to your inherent desire to discover. If you keep trying to silence that sense of wonder, happiness will fade away with it.",

Do not pursue what is illusionary — property and position: all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade, and is confiscated in one fell night.\n\nLive with a steady superiority over life — don’t be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn for happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn’t last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing. It is enough if you don’t freeze in the cold and if thirst and hunger don’t claw at your insides. If your back isn’t broken … then whom should you envy? And why?\n\nOur envy of others devours us most of all. Prize above all else in the world those who love you and who wish you well. Do not hurt them or scold them, and never part from any of them in anger; after all, you simply do not know: it may be your last act before your arrest, and that will be how you are imprinted on their memory.",

This helps me to understand the Why of the task, and keeps me motivated when things get hard. Often the Why is something like, “To help my readers with a problem” and this feels good when I’m doing the task. That’s a much better reason than, “Because it’s on my list” or “Because I got an email asking me to do it",

In both Zen and marriage there's the practice of vowing, intentionally taking on a path, even if we know we won't get to the destination. Vowing is liberation from whim and weakness. It creates possibilities that would not occur otherwise, because when you are willing to stick to something, come what may, even if from time to time you don't feel like sticking to it, a magic arises, and you find yourself feeling and doing noble things you did not know you were capable of.",

When I am lying in bed as my mind wanders before falling to sleep. These \"wasted\" moments, moments not filled with anything in particular, are vital.\n\nThey are the moments in which we, often unconsciously, organize our minds, make sense of our lives, and connect the dots. They're the moments in which we talk to ourselves. And listen.\n\nTo lose those moments, to replace them with tasks and efficiency, is a mistake. What's worse is that we don't just lose them. We actively throw them away.",
